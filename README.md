+ Find the link to your personal Steam page and write it into `crawler/crawler.py, LN 14`, your steam profile has to be public.
  *After login, put the mouse cursor on your username on the navbar and click 'PROFILE' in the drop-down menu. The URL (***don't forget https://***) of the profile page is what you need.* The profile page should look like the following image.
